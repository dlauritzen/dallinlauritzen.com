# DallinLauritzen.com

This repository hosts the source for my personal/professional website,
<http://www.dallinlauritzen.com>. The domain is hosted by
[DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com), running Django 1.2.x and
Python 2.x. The UI is [Flat UI](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/)
with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)'s responsive
layout added (Flat UI is built on Bootstrap anyway).

## Sensitive Data

Database credentials and other sensitive data are read from a file in
the root directory called sensitive.json. The Git repo is configured
to not include this file so my credentials are not released as
open-source.

page](http://www.dallinlauritzen.com/contact/) to see how to contact
